        <p>
          People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is the largest animal
           rights organization in the world, with more than 6.5 million members and supporters.

           <br>
           <br>

          PETA opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview, 
          and focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest 
          numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of 
          time: in laboratories, in the food industry, in the clothing trade, and in 
          the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, 
          including the cruel killing of rodents, birds, and other animals who are 
          often considered “pests” as well as cruelty to domesticated animals.

          <br>
          <br>
          
          PETA works through public education, cruelty investigations, research, 
          animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.
